  "description": "<h2>Capacity to Ship Packages Within D Days</h2><p>Leetcode 1011. Capacity to Ship Packages Within D Days</p><p></p><p>A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within `days` days.</p><p></p><p>The `ith` package on the conveyor belt has a weight of `weights[i]`. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by `weights`). It is not allowed to load weight more than the **maximum weight capacity** of the ship.</p><p></p><p>Return the **least weight capacity** of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within `days` days.</p><h3>Examples:</h3><ul><li>Input: weights = [2,4,6,1,3,10], days = 4<br><br>Output: 10<br>1st day: [2]\n2nd day: [4,6]\n3rd day: [1,3]\n4th day: [10]</li><li>Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5], days = 5<br><br>Output: 5<br>1st day: [1]\n2nd day: [2]\n3rd day: [3]\n4th day: [4]\n5th day: [5]</li><li>Input: weights = [1,5,4,4,2,3], days = 3<br><br>Output: 8<br>1st day = [1,5]\n2nd day = [4,4]\n3rd day = [2,3]</li></ul><h3>Constraints:</h3><ul><li> `1 <= days, weights.length <= 50,000`</li><li> `1 <= weights[i] <= 500`</li></ul>",
