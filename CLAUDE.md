# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AlgoLounge is an interactive coding practice platform built with Angular 19.2. It provides hands-on programming challenges and structured courses for developers to practice algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills. The platform supports multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java) with in-browser code execution.

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
- `npm start` or `ng serve` - Start development server on http://localhost:4200
- `ng build` - Build for production (outputs to dist/alglounge)
- `ng test` - Run unit tests with Karma
- `npm run sync-index` - Sync questions and courses index files after adding new content

### Angular CLI Commands
- `ng generate component component-name` - Generate new component
- `ng generate service service-name` - Generate new service
- `ng build --watch --configuration development` - Build in watch mode for development

## Architecture Overview

### Core Application Structure
- **Angular 19.2** with standalone components architecture
- **Routing**: Main routes include `/home`, `/questions/:name`, `/courses`, `/courses/:filename`
- **State Management**: Local storage service for progress tracking and completed questions
- **UI Components**: PrimeNG for UI components with custom theming

### Key Services
- **CodeExecutionService** (`src/app/services/code-execution.service.ts`): Handles multi-language code execution
  - Python: Uses Pyodide (browser-based Python runtime)
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: Uses Function constructor for safe execution
  - Java: Uses CheerpJ for browser-based JVM with ECJ compiler
- **LocalStorageService**: Manages user progress and completed questions
- **Course/Question Services**: Handle loading and searching course/question data

### Code Execution Architecture
The platform executes code entirely in the browser:
- **Python**: Loads Pyodide from CDN, executes in isolated context
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Strips TypeScript annotations and executes with Function constructor
- **Java**: Compiles with ECJ (Eclipse Compiler for Java) via CheerpJ, packages as JAR, and executes

### Content Structure
- **Questions**: JSON files in `public/questions/` with multi-language support
  - Each question has `languages` object with `python`, `javascript`, `typescript`, `java` keys
  - Contains templates, solutions, test cases, and descriptions
- **Courses**: JSON files in `public/courses/` with structured learning paths
  - Organized in units with question sequences
- **Index Files**: Auto-generated by `sync-index.js` script for search functionality

### Component Architecture
- **Pages**: Main route components (Home, Questions, Courses, CourseDetail, NotFound)
- **Questions Page Components**:
  - `IdeComponent`: CodeMirror-based code editor with syntax highlighting
  - `ConsoleComponent`: Test results and execution output display
  - `ContentTabsComponent`: Description, solution tabs with completion tracking
- **Services Integration**: Components use dependency injection for CodeExecutionService and LocalStorageService

### Key Features
- **Multi-language Support**: Same problems available in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java
- **Progress Tracking**: Local storage persistence of completed questions
- **Test Execution**: Automated test case validation with detailed feedback
- **Course System**: Structured learning paths with unit organization
- **Dark Mode**: Supported throughout the application

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Questions
1. Create JSON file in `public/questions/` following the multi-language format
2. Include all supported languages with templates and solutions
3. Add comprehensive test cases with expected outputs
4. Run `npm run sync-index` to update search indices

### Adding New Courses
1. Create JSON file in `public/courses/` with course structure
2. Organize content in units with question references
3. Run `npm run sync-index` to update indices

### Working with Code Execution
- Test new language features thoroughly across all supported languages
- Ensure proper error handling for compilation and runtime errors
- Validate test case formats and execution results
- Consider performance implications of browser-based execution

### Component Development
- Use Angular standalone component architecture
- Follow existing patterns for dependency injection
- Implement proper lifecycle management for resource cleanup
- Use PrimeNG components for consistent UI

## Testing

### Running Tests
- `ng test` - Executes unit tests with Karma and Jasmine
- Test files use `.spec.ts` extension and are located alongside components/services

### Question Validation
- Use validation scripts like `validate-solutions.js` and test files in root directory
- Ensure all question solutions work across supported languages
- Verify test cases produce expected outputs
